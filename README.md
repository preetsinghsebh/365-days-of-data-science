# 365 Days of Data Science 🚀

Daily hands-on data science practice using Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine Learning, and real-world datasets.

This repository documents my journey of building **real, recruiter-ready projects** consistently for 365 days.

## What you'll find here
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Models
- SQL & Business Analytics
- Real-world datasets (Kaggle, public data)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SQL
- Google Colab

📌 **Goal**: Become job-ready by building projects publicly and consistently.

## Project Status

The Netflix data analysis project (Day 1–Day 7) is complete.

This project represents an end-to-end data analysis workflow including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SQL-style analytical queries using pandas
- Business-oriented insights
- Interview-style mini case study
- Final refinement and documentation

This project is now portfolio-ready and will remain unchanged except for
minor fixes or interview-specific improvements.
