# Day 25 – E-Commerce Project Completion ✅

## Project Status
The end-to-end E-Commerce Customer Behavior & Revenue Analysis project is now **completed**.

This project spanned multiple days and focused on moving from raw transactional data to clear, business-driven insights.

---

## What Was Covered
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Revenue trends over time
- Product category performance analysis
- Customer contribution analysis
- Business-oriented insights & validation checks

---

## Key Learnings
- A small number of product categories drive a large share of total revenue
- Revenue distribution is skewed due to high-value customers
- Asking **better questions** matters more than adding more plots
- Clear documentation is as important as clean code

---

## Outcome
- Built a recruiter-ready, structured analytics project
- Practiced translating data into business insights
- Strengthened project documentation and clarity

---

## Next Steps
- Start a **new dataset** from scratch
- Apply lessons learned (cleaner structure, faster insights)
- Focus on depth over volume

📌 *Closing projects properly is a skill. Day 25 was about doing that right.*
